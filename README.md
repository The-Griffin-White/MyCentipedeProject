# MyCentipedeProject

Created using TEAL engine supplied by professor Andre Berthiaume at DePaul University. TEAL opens the game window and updates frames but little else.

SFML and other necessary references included.

Works in debug, would need to update libraries for release. It's just centipede so release optimization is pretty unnecessary.
